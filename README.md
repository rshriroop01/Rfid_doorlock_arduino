# Arduino Based RFID Door Lock 
This poject is about building your won RFID door lock mechanism which is based on the Arduino Uno and the RC522 RFID sensor, which allows you to use RFID tags or cards to lock and unlock a door, drawer or cupboard,etc . You can load as many RFID tags as youâ€™d like onto the Arduino and add or remove tags to provide more or fewer people with access.
